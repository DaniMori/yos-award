# Action points

## Completion of the form fields

#### Debate

- Changes in section "output" are pending

- Branch `drafting/reusability` was incorrectly merged to `main` instead of
  `drafting/template-fillin` as it was intended to

#### Agreements

#### Tasks

-   **Roberto**: Review the remaining of the draft [ASAP]

-   **Roberto**: Submit form to Yerun Open Science Awards call [21/12/2022]

## Team description section

#### Debate

-   Suggested that the "team description" would better include a description of
    the whole group, instead of the individuals making it up as it is.
    
-   We consider it more practical to leave it "as is" though.

#### Agreements

-   **Rejected**: Change the description to a "group description".

#### Tasks

-   **Roberto**: Complete the "team description" section in the final draft, in
    branch `drafting/template-fillin` [ASAP]

## Retrospective session
